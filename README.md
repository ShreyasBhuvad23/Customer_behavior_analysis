# Customer_behavior_analysis
## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end **data analytics workflow**, from data ingestion to insight presentation. It is designed to showcase practical skills in Python, SQL, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and business intelligence reporting using Power BI. The final outputs include an interactive dashboard, a written report, and a presentation created with Gamma.

The project is structured to be **clear, reproducible, and recruiter-friendly**, highlighting both technical and analytical thinking.

## Dataset

* **Source:** (Add dataset source or link here)
* **Format:** CSV / Excel / Database table
* **Description:**

  * Contains structured data used for analysis and visualization
  * Includes numerical and categorical variables relevant to the business problem

> Note: Raw data is kept unchanged. All transformations are performed on a cleaned copy.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading**

   * Imported dataset into Python using pandas
   * Performed initial inspection (shape, data types, missing values)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Summary statistics and distributions
   * Trend and pattern analysis
   * Identification of outliers and data quality issues

3. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

   * Handled missing values
   * Removed duplicates and corrected data types
   * Created derived features for analysis

4. **SQL Analysis**

   * Loaded cleaned data into a relational database
   * Wrote SQL queries for:

     * Aggregations and KPIs
     * Filtering and joins
     * Business-focused insights

5. **Dashboard Development (Power BI)**

   * Connected Power BI to the database / cleaned dataset
   * Built interactive visuals and filters
   * Designed a clean, business-ready dashboard

6. **Reporting & Presentation**

   * Created a written analytical report summarizing insights
   * Built a presentation in Gamma for stakeholder communication

## Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard includes:

* Key performance indicators (KPIs)
* Trend analysis over time
* Category and segment comparisons
* Interactive filters for deeper exploration

> Screenshots or a Power BI Service link can be added here.

## Results & Insights

* Identified key trends and patterns in the data
* Highlighted drivers impacting performance metrics
* Provided actionable insights supported by data

The analysis translates raw data into **clear, decision-ready insights**.
